# 🎨 Object Customization with Textual Inversion

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores how **Textual Inversion** can be used to customize object generation in **Stable Diffusion**, a state-of-the-art text-to-image model.

By teaching the model new concepts using only a few reference images, we can generate images of personalized objects in various styles, contexts, and environments — all through text prompts.

## 🧠 What is Stable Diffusion?

**Stable Diffusion** is a powerful generative AI model developed by Stability AI that creates realistic images from textual descriptions by:

1. Starting with random noise
2. Gradually "denoising" over several steps
3. Using the **text prompt** as a guide to shape the final image

## 🧩 What is Textual Inversion?

**Textual Inversion** is a technique that enables Stable Diffusion to learn new concepts using just 3–5 reference images.

- It creates a new *"pseudo-token"* (e.g., `<my-cat>`) with a custom embedding.
- This embedding is trained to reproduce the reference images when used in prompts.
- Once trained, it allows users to generate images like:
  - `A painting of <my-cat> in Renaissance style`
  - `<my-cat> flying on the moon`
  - `Cartoon version of <my-cat> in a jungle`

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 📸 Step 1: Collect Reference Images
Gather 3–5 high-quality images of the object (e.g., a pet, toy, or furniture) you want to teach the model.

### 🧪 Step 2: Training the Custom Embedding
- Choose a placeholder token: `<my-object>`
- Initialize the token embedding
- Train only this embedding while freezing the rest of the model
- Optimize to match the reference images in outputs

### ✨ Step 3: Generate Customized Images
Use the token in prompts with desired styles, scenes, or modifiers:
```text
"A photorealistic portrait of <my-object> in a futuristic city"
"Pixel art of <my-object> on Mars"
"A Van Gogh-style painting of <my-object>"
